Number converter for programmers (dec/bin/oct/hex)

Simple and small in size utility tool for converting numbers to other formats that will easily fit into the corner of your screen. 
I think it was one of the first (if not *the* first) programs I wrote in C#. Still, it proved to be quite useful.
The repository contains the bin folder with a release version (.exe file).
